## U.S. Perceptions of Chinese immigrants from 1900-1950
**ZhengKai Ng(Isaac)**

For the intellecutal context for this collection,the 1978 book [*Orientalism*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orientalism_(book)) by Edward Said brings forth that Orientalism is a practice and study primarily from European and later American writers and scholars in helping to characterize the Occident (West), by bringing contrasting ideas from an “Other,” particularly the Orient (East).His idea is that the Occident’s purpose “to control, manipulate, even to incorporate, what is a manifestly different world,”  in this case the “Orient” and in turn, the Chinese. By doing so through scholarly texts or literature, written primarily by writers of the Anglosphere, texts of knowledge written by reputable sources not only showcase power but also highlight how the knowledge itself is a form of power that shapes and creates an imbalance of status between the “Orient” and the “Occident”. With this understanding in mind, cookbooks itself then can also showcase evidence of this idea through the illustrations or phrasing of certain texts within it.

As mentioned before, this collection focuses on digitized pages of Chinese cuisine cookbooks published within the U.S. during the early 20th century (1900-1950). The reason for focusing on this specific period of time is because of the negative perceptions of Chinese immigrants which was prevalent within the U.S.at the time.  Contextual evidence of anti Chinese immigrant sentiments was the [Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Exclusion_Act) , along with the [Immigration Act of 1924](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immigration_Act_of_1924) which prevented any further immigration from Asia during the early 20th century. Due to these reasons, the unique existence of Chinese cookbooks and cuisine displays a unique lens of perceptions related to the American Chinese immigrants. 

Cookbooks during this period can showcase the anti Chinese sentiments during this period or a patronizing perspective people had of the Chinese diaspora through the illustrations found within the books. However cookbooks can also be evidence of attempts to lessen the negative perceptions during the period as well , with some authors attempting to dispell ideas of repulsiveness that circulated about the Chinese during that time through sharing of recipes and the cuisine itself.
